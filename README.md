# VT-Football-HTML-Scrape-Clean-and-Vis
This project features an HTML scrape off of the VT Football website (works as of 2026). The data consists of players, height, weight, hometown, and more. Throughout the data cleaning and transformation process, I appropriately deal with nulls, dups in a should-be-unique column, and string data that should be split into multiple columns. I create dictionaries, functions, and visualizations that help me understand the distribution and values of data. I finish it off with some visualizations that show BMI and weight class! Packages used:pandas, beautiful soup, numpy, matplotlib, requests)
